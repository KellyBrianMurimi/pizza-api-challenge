.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # App setup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py             # DB config, etc.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/               # üíæ Models (SQLAlchemy)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restaurant.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restaurant_pizza.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/          # üéØ Route handlers (Controllers)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restaurant_controller.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza_controller.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ restaurant_pizza_controller.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed.py               # Seed data
